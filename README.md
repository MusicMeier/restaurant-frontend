A community of people who love Studio Ghibli films!
<br></br>
<h2>General Info</h2>
<p>
Studio Ghibli Film Finder & Friend Zone is a CLI application that allows users to create a profile, discover Studio Ghibli films and read their descriptions, add films to their favorites and view them.<br>
<br>"Let's Lose Our Way, Together." :heart:</br>
</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>We started our project with the hope of connecting people through a common interest. Studio Ghibli films are beloved by many, and we wanted to be able to pair users based on their common favorites. Through that connection, we wanted to be able to randomize movie suggestions based on films that were not listed in their favorites.</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<h3>As a user, you will be able to:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Join the Studio Ghibli community.</li>
<li>See a curated list of the top 10 film suggestions based on Rotten Tomatoes scores.</li>
<li>Explore the Studio Ghibli film catalogue.</li>
<li>See and add films to a list of your favorites.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>We set out to match users based on favorite films. We would’ve liked to create an app that delivered on that.</p>

With time, we would've liked to refactor our code and add features such as:
<li>Updating Favorites</li>
<li>Removing Favorites</li>
<li>Match with a Friend</li>
<li>Once a user signs up, returning that user to log in screen.</li>
